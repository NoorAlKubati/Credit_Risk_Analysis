# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize several machine learning algorithms to solve for credit card risk. The analysis is produced using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. It is inherently known that the issue of credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem, due to the fact that good loans predominantly outnumber risky loans. Accordingly, various techniques and models will be applied and compared to evaluate unbalanced classes. Specifically, different resampling methods will be applied and the resulting models will be evaluated and compared in order to identify which one best minimizes bias most and predicts credit risk best. Finally, after these models are compared, it will be clear whether any (or all) are good at what they claim they do.
